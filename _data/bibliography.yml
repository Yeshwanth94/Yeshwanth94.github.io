  abstract: "The quality of generative models depends on the quality of the data they are trained on. Creating large-scale, high-quality datasets is often expensive and sometimes impossible, e.g. in certain scientific applications where there is no access to clean data due to physical or instrumentation constraints. Ambient Diffusion and related frameworks train diffusion models with solely corrupted data (which are usually cheaper to acquire) but ambient models significantly underperform models trained on clean data. We study this phenomenon at scale by training more than \\(80\\)  models on data with different corruption levels across three datasets ranging from \\(30,000\\) to \\(\\approx 1.3\\)M samples. We show that it is impossible, at these sample sizes, to match the performance of models trained on clean data when only training on noisy data. Yet, a combination of a small set of clean data (e.g.~\\(10\\%\\) of the total dataset) and a large set of highly noisy data suffices to reach the performance of models trained solely on similar-size datasets of clean data, and in particular to achieve near state-of-the-art performance. We provide theoretical evidence for our findings by developing novel sample complexity bounds for learning from Gaussian Mixtures with heterogeneous variances. Our theoretical model suggests that, for large enough datasets, the effective marginal utility of a noisy sample is exponentially worse than that of a clean sample. Providing a small set of clean samples can significantly reduce the sample size requirements for noisy data, as we also observe in our experiments."

  abstract:
    "We investigate the quantitative performance of affine-equivariant estimators
    for robust mean estimation. As a natural stability requirement, the
    construction of such affine-equivariant estimators has been extensively studied
    in the statistics literature. We quantitatively evaluate these estimators under
    two outlier models which have been the subject of much recent work: the
    heavy-tailed and adversarial corruption settings. We establish lower bounds
    which show that affine-equivariance induces a strict degradation in recovery
    error with quantitative rates degrading by a factor of \\(\\sqrt{d}\\) in both
    settings. We find that classical estimators such as the Tukey median (Tukey
    '75) and Stahel-Donoho estimator (Stahel '81 and Donoho '82) are either
    quantitatively sub-optimal even within the class of affine-equivariant
    estimators or lack any quantitative guarantees. On the other hand, recent
    estimators with strong quantitative guarantees are not affine-equivariant or
    require additional distributional assumptions to achieve it. We remedy this by
    constructing a new affine-equivariant estimator which nearly matches our lower
    bound. Our estimator is based on a novel notion of a high-dimensional median
    which may be of independent interest. Notably, our results are applicable more
    broadly to any estimator whose performance is evaluated in the Mahalanobis norm
    which, for affine-equivariant estimators, corresponds to an evaluation in
    Euclidean norm on isotropic distributions."

  abstract: 
    "Automated mechanistic interpretation research has attracted great interest due to its potential to scale explanations of neural network internals to large models. Existing automated circuit discovery work relies on activation patching or its approximations to identify subgraphs in models for specific tasks (circuits). They often suffer from slow runtime, approximation errors, and specific requirements of metrics, such as non-zero gradients. In this work, we introduce contextual decomposition for transformers (CD-T) to build interpretable circuits in large language models. CD-T can produce circuits of arbitrary level of abstraction, and is the first able to produce circuits as fine-grained as attention heads at specific sequence positions efficiently. CD-T consists of a set of mathematical equations to isolate contribution of model features. Through recursively computing contribution of all nodes in a computational graph of a model using CD-T followed by pruning, we are able to reduce circuit discovery runtime from hours to seconds compared to state-of-the-art baselines. On three standard circuit evaluation datasets (indirect object identification, greater-than comparisons, and docstring completion), we demonstrate that CD-T outperforms ACDC and EAP by better recovering the manual circuits with an average of 97% ROC AUC under low runtimes. In addition, we provide evidence that faithfulness of CD-T circuits is not due to random chance by showing our circuits are 80% more faithful than random circuits of up to 60% of the original model size. Finally, we show CD-T circuits are able to perfectly replicate original models' behavior (faithfulness \\(= 1\\)) using fewer nodes than the baselines for all tasks. Our results underscore the great promise of CD-T for efficient automated mechanistic interpretability, paving the way for new insights into the workings of large language models."

    "Pre-trained transformers are often fine-tuned to aid clinical decision-making
    using limited clinical notes. Model interpretability is crucial, especially in
    high-stakes domains like medicine, to establish trust and ensure safety, which
    requires human engagement. We introduce SUFO, a systematic framework that
    enhances interpretability of fine-tuned transformer feature spaces. SUFO
    utilizes a range of analytic and visualization techniques, including Supervised
    probing, Unsupervised similarity analysis, Feature dynamics, and Outlier
    analysis to address key questions about model trust and interpretability. We
    conduct a case study investigating the impact of pre-training data where we
    focus on real-world pathology classification tasks, and validate our findings
    on MedNLI. We evaluate five 110M-sized pre-trained transformer models,
    categorized into general-domain (BERT, TNLR), mixed-domain (BioBERT, Clinical
    BioBERT), and domain-specific (PubMedBERT) groups. Our SUFO analyses reveal
    that: (1) while PubMedBERT, the domain-specific model, contains valuable
    information for fine-tuning, it can overfit to minority classes when class
    imbalances exist. In contrast, mixed-domain models exhibit greater resistance
    to overfitting, suggesting potential improvements in domain-specific model
    robustness; (2) in-domain pre-training accelerates feature disambiguation
    during fine-tuning; and (3) feature spaces undergo significant sparsification
    during this process, enabling clinicians to identify common outlier modes among
    fine-tuned models as demonstrated in this paper. These findings showcase the
    utility of SUFO in enhancing trust and safety when using transformers in
    medicine, and we believe SUFO can aid practitioners in evaluating fine-tuned
    language models for other applications in medicine and in more critical
    domains."

  abstract:
    "In statistical learning theory, determining the sample complexity of
    realizable binary classification for VC classes was a long-standing open
    problem. The results of Simon and Hanneke established sharp upper bounds in
    this setting. However, the reliance of their argument on the uniform
    convergence principle limits its applicability to more general learning
    settings such as multiclass classification. In this paper, we address this
    issue by providing optimal high probability risk bounds through a framework
    that surpasses the limitations of uniform convergence arguments.<br><br>

    Our framework converts the leave-one-out error of permutation invariant
    predictors into high probability risk bounds. As an application, by adapting
    the one-inclusion graph algorithm of Haussler, Littlestone, and Warmuth, we
    propose an algorithm that achieves an optimal PAC bound for binary
    classification. Specifically, our result shows that certain aggregations of
    one-inclusion graph algorithms are optimal, addressing a variant of a classic
    question posed by Warmuth.<br><br>

    We further instantiate our framework in three settings where uniform
    convergence is provably suboptimal. For multiclass classification, we prove an
    optimal risk bound that scales with the one-inclusion hypergraph density of the
    class, addressing the suboptimality of the analysis of Daniely and
    Shalev-Shwartz. For partial hypothesis classification, we determine the optimal
    sample complexity bound, resolving a question posed by Alon, Hanneke, Holzman,
    and Moran. For realizable bounded regression with absolute loss, we derive an
    optimal risk bound that relies on a modified version of the scale-sensitive
    dimension, refining the results of Bartlett and Long. Our rates surpass
    standard uniform convergence-based results due to the smaller complexity
    measure in our risk bound."

    "The one-inclusion graph algorithm of Haussler, Littlestone, and Warmuth
    achieves an optimal in-expectation risk bound in the standard PAC
    classification setup. In one of the first COLT open problems, Warmuth
    conjectured that this prediction strategy always implies an optimal high
    probability bound on the risk, and hence is also an optimal PAC algorithm. We
    refute this conjecture in the strongest sense: for any practically interesting
    Vapnik-Chervonenkis class, we provide an in-expectation optimal one-inclusion
    graph algorithm whose high probability risk bound cannot go beyond that implied
    by Markov's inequality. Our construction of these poorly performing
    one-inclusion graph algorithms uses Varshamov-Tenengolts error correcting
    codes.<br><br>

    Our negative result has several implications. First, it shows that the same
    poor high-probability performance is inherited by several recent prediction
    strategies based on generalizations of the one-inclusion graph algorithm.
    Second, our analysis shows yet another statistical problem that enjoys an
    estimator that is provably optimal in expectation via a leave-one-out argument,
    but fails in the high-probability regime. This discrepancy occurs despite the
    boundedness of the binary loss for which arguments based on concentration
    inequalities often provide sharp high probability risk bounds."

  abstract:
    "We study fundamental problems in linear algebra, such as finding a maximal
    linearly independent subset of rows or columns (a basis), solving linear
    regression, or computing a subspace embedding. For these problems, we consider
    input matrices \\(\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}\\ \\) with \\(n > d\\). The input
    can be read in \\(\\text{nnz}(\\mathbf{A})\\ \\) time, which denotes the number of
    nonzero entries of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). In this paper, we show that beyond the time
    required to read the input matrix, these fundamental linear algebra problems
    can be solved in \\(d^{\\omega}\\ \\) time, i.e., where \\(\\omega \\approx 2.37\\ \\) is the
    current matrix-multiplication exponent.<br><br>

    To do so, we introduce a constant-factor subspace embedding with the optimal
    \\(m=\\mathcal{O}(d)\\ \\) number of rows, and which can be applied in time
    \\(\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{\\text{nnz}(\\mathbf{A})}{\\alpha}\\right) + d^{2 +

    a recent result by Chepurko et. al. [SODA 2022] that achieves an

    \\(\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{\\text{nnz}(\\mathbf{A})}{\\alpha}+d^{2+\\alpha+o(1)}\\right)\\ \\)

    Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transforms (SRHT), which actually increase the
    input dimension, to \"spread\" the mass of an input vector among a large number
    of coordinates, followed by random sampling. To control the effects of random
    sampling, we use fast semidefinite programming to reweight the rows. We then
    use our constant-factor subspace embedding to give the first optimal runtime
    algorithms for finding a maximal linearly independent subset of columns,
    regression, and leverage score sampling. To do so, we also introduce a novel
    subroutine that iteratively grows a set of independent rows, which may be of
    independent interest."

    in these networks because the functions that they compute are very close to
    linear. Bottleneck layers in the network play a key role: the minimal width up
    to some point in the network determines scales and sensitivities of mappings
    computed up to that point. The main result is for networks with constant depth,

    \\(\\lVert q - x_i \\rVert_p\\ \\) with high probability for all \\(i\\in[n]\\). The main
    novelty is our data structure's correctness guarantee holds even when the
    sequence of queries can be chosen adaptively: an adversary is allowed to choose
    the \\(j\\)th query point \\(q_j\\ \\) in a way that depends on the answers reported by
    the data structure for \\(q_1,\\ldots,q_{j-1}\\). Previous randomized Monte Carlo
    methods do not provide error guarantees in the setting of adaptively chosen
    queries. Our memory consumption is \\(\\tilde O((n+d)d/\\epsilon^2)\\), slightly more
    than the \\(O(nd)\\ \\) required to store \\(X\\ \\) in memory explicitly, but with the
    benefit that our time to answer queries is only \\(\\tilde O(\\epsilon^{-2}(n +
    d))\\), much faster than the naive \\(\\Theta(nd)\\ \\) time obtained from a linear scan
    in the case of \\(n\\ \\) and \\(d\\ \\) very large. Here \\(\\tilde O\\ \\) hides
    \\(\\log(nd/\\epsilon)\\ \\) factors. We discuss applications to nearest neighbor search
    and nonparametric estimation.<br><br>

    Our method is simple and likely to be applicable to other domains: we
    describe a generic approach for transforming randomized Monte Carlo data
    structures which do not support adaptive queries to ones that do, and show that
    for the problem at hand, it can be applied to standard nonadaptive solutions to
    \\(\\ell_p\\ \\) norm estimation with negligible overhead in query time and a factor
    \\(d\\ \\) overhead in memory."

Prior to our work, polynomial time algorithms achieving near optimal sample complexities were only known in the setting where \\(X\\) is Gaussian with identity covariance and \\(\\epsilon\\) is Gaussian, and no linear time estimators were known for robust linear regression in any setting. Our estimators and their analysis leverage recent developments in the construction of faster algorithms for robust mean estimation to improve runtimes, and refined concentration of measure arguments alongside Gaussian rounding techniques to improve statistical sample complexities."

    "Learning from data in the presence of outliers is a fundamental problem in
    statistics. Until recently, no computationally efficient algorithms were known
    to compute the mean of a high dimensional distribution under natural
    assumptions in the presence of even a small fraction of outliers. In this
    paper, we consider robust statistics in the presence of overwhelming outliers
    where the majority of the dataset is introduced adversarially. With only an
    \\(\\alpha < 1/2\\ \\) fraction of \"inliers\" (clean data) the mean of a distribution is
    unidentifiable. However, in their influential work, [CSV17] introduces a
    polynomial time algorithm recovering the mean of distributions with bounded
    covariance by outputting a succinct list of \\(O(1/\\alpha)\\ \\) candidate solutions,
    one of which is guaranteed to be close to the true distributional mean; a
    direct analog of 'List Decoding' in the theory of error correcting codes. In
    this work, we develop an algorithm for list decodable mean estimation in the
    same setting achieving up to constants the information theoretically optimal
    recovery, optimal sample complexity, and in nearly linear time up to
    polylogarithmic factors in dimension. Our conceptual innovation is to design a
    descent style algorithm on a nonconvex landscape, iteratively removing minima
    to generate a succinct list of solutions. Our runtime bottleneck is a
    saddle-point optimization for which we design custom primal dual solvers for
    generalized packing and covering SDP's under Ky-Fan norms, which may be of
    independent interest."

    For covariance estimation, linear regression, and several other problems,

We propose a simple projected gradient descent method to estimate the low-rank matrix that alternately performs a projected gradient descent step and cleans up a few of the corrupted entries using hard-thresholding. Our algorithm solves RMC using nearly optimal number of observations as well as nearly optimal number of corruptions. Our result also implies significant improvement over the existing time complexity bounds for the low-rank matrix completion problem. Finally, an application of our result to the robust PCA problem (low-rank+sparse matrix separation) leads to nearly linear time (in matrix dimensions) algorithm for the same; existing state-of-the-art methods require quadratic time. Our empirical results corroborate our theoretical results and show that even for moderate sized problems, our method for robust PCA is an an order of magnitude faster than the existing methods."
