I am a postdoc at MIT where I am fortunate to be mentored by [Costis Daskalakis](https://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/). I completed my Ph.D at U.C. Berkeley where I was adivsed by [Peter Bartlett](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/). Previously, I spent two wonderful years at MSR Bangalore where I worked with [Prateek Jain](https://www.prateekjain.org), [Nagarajan Natarajan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nagarajn/), and [Praneeth Netrapalli](https://praneethnetrapalli.org/). Previously, I was advised by [Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/) and [Soumen Chakrabarti](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/) for my undergraduate thesis at IIT Bombay.

My research aims to build reliable machine learning algorithms which can cope with unprecendented challenges in the modern data production pipeline. Here are some directions that I am particularly excited about illustrating this theme:

**Inference with Outliers:** *What are the statistical limits of estimation with outliers in the data?* ({% assign id="cherapanamjeri2019fast" %}{% include footnote-bib-row.liquid %}{% assign id="cherapanamjeri2020algorithms" %}{% include footnote-bib-row.liquid %}{% assign id="cherapanamjeri2020list" %}{% include footnote-bib-row.liquid %}{% assign id="cherapanamjeri2020optimal" %}{% include footnote-bib-row.liquid %}) and *Can we realize these limits computationally?* ({% assign id="cherapanamjeri2022optimal" %}{% include footnote-bib-row.liquid %}{% assign id="chen2025statistical" %}{% include footnote-bib-row.liquid %}) These ideas have implacations for other questions in statistics and theoretical computer science including classical PAC learning theory ({% assign id="aden-ali2023optimal" %}{% include footnote-bib-row.liquid %}), and streaming data structures ({% assign id="cherapanamjeri2020on" %}{% include footnote-bib-row.liquid %}{% assign id="cherapanamjeri2021terminal" %}{% include footnote-bib-row.liquid %}{% assign id="cherapanamjeri2022uniform" %}{% include footnote-bib-row.liquid %}).

**Data from Strategic Interactions:** Sometimes, data is systematically biased due to the strategic behavior of the data-generating agents. For instance, data collected from online marketplaces is not a true reflection of the participants' utilities. *How should we account for this strategic behavior to design statistically and computationally efficient estimators?* ({% assign id="cherapanamjeri2022estimation" %}{% include footnote-bib-row.liquid %}{% assign id="cherapanamjeri2023what" %}{% include footnote-bib-row.liquid %})

**Dataset Design:** Modern datasets are collected from a range of sources of varying data quality with low-quality data being cheap while high-quality data is vastly more expensive. This raises several questions: *How should a practitioner prioritize between these sources? Are there inherent limitations of the use of certain data sources? What are the statistical costs of low-quality data?* ({% assign id="daras2025how" %}{%- include footnote-bib-row.liquid -%}{% assign id="cherapanamjeri2025are" %}{%- include footnote-bib-row.liquid -%})
